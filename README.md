**MIDI Viewer** and **OSC Viewer** are community-created plugins for
**[Linux Show Player](https://github.com/FrancescoCeruti/linux-show-player)**

These plugin adds non-modal dialog windows in which incoming MIDI and OSC messages are listed as
they arrive. These windows may be opened via an option on the "Tools" menu.


### Installation

To use, place the contents in a subfolder of `$XDG_DATA_HOME/LinuxShowPlayer/$LiSP_Version/plugins/`
(On most Linux systems, this will default to `~/.local/share/LinuxShowPlayer/0.6/plugins/`.)

When you next start **Linux Show Player**, the program should load the plugin automatically.
