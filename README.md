The **Protocol Monitor** is a community-created plugin for
**[Linux Show Player](https://github.com/FrancescoCeruti/linux-show-player)**

This plugin adds a tabbed non-modal dialog window in which incoming MIDI and OSC
messages are listed as they arrive. This window may be opened via an option on
the "Tools" menu.


### Installation

To use, navigate to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/LinuxShowPlayer/$LiSP_Version/plugins/` (on
most Linux systems `$XDG_DATA_HOME` is `~/.local/share`), and create a subfolder
named `protocol_monitor`.

Place the files comprising this plugin into this new folder.

When you next start **Linux Show Player**, the program should load this plugin
automatically.
